Description: bUpNal-Hutta
Remote ice planet where the crystals that focus lightsabers are mined. It is later revealed to have been converted by the First Order into the superweapon Starkiller Base, which is ultimately destroyed by the Resistance. Prior to this reveal, there were speculations that the two planets might be one and the same, as official reference guides state the diameters of both to be 660 kilometres (410 mi). Additionally, the video game Jedi: Fallen Order depicts the planet with a huge trench resembling the superweapon's appearance as a result of the Galactic Empire's excavations.[47]
