Description: BapUtapau
Snowy planet of forested mountains converted by the First Order into a superweapon. It is later revealed to have once been the planet Illum, where lightsaber crystals originated from, as the video game Jedi: Fallen Order revealed that the Galactic Empire had been doing excavation on Ilum, resulting in a large trench along the equator of the planet, giving it an appearance similar to the superweapon. Ilum and Starkiller Base also share the same dimensions, being 660 kilometres (410Â mi). The planet is ultimately destroyed by the Resistance, and also serves as the death place of Han Solo.
