Description: BOPNal-Hutta
An inhospitable junkyard planet located in the Mid Rim. During the Clone Wars, the planetâ€™s industrial base and close proximity to hyperspace lanes ensured it was the site of several fierce battles as both sides vied for the strategically important world. It was later used by the Scrapper Guild to salvage the components of decommissioned ships and sell them to the Empire who used them to construct new weapons of war.
